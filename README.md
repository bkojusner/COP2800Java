# COP2800Java
Various Java Programs I developed in a Java Programming Course at UF

There are 6 assignments uploaded in here:

Assignment 1:
"Using While loops described in class, develop a java program that calculates 
the total sum (initialized by zero) of numbers based on user inputs as follows:

Category 1, ifnumber is between 1 and 5 (1 and 5 are included in range): 
I.Multiply this number by 2.
II.Add the result to the total sum.
III.Ask the user to enter a new number.

Category 2, if number is between 6 and 10 (6 and 10 are included in range): 
I.Multiply this number by 2 then add 1.
II.Add the result to the total sum.
III.Ask the user to enter a new number.

If any other number other than zero: Ignore the number and ask the user to enter a new number.

If the user entered zero: 
I.Exit the loop.
II.Print the value of the total sum."

Assignment 2:
"Using both loops and arrays concepts described in class, develop a java program that :
1)Defines an ​empty​ array of 10 integers.
2)Uses ​while​ loop to fill the array with random integer values from 1 to 100 (100 isincluded).
3)Uses another ​for​ loop to:
●Display the content of the array.
●Count how many numbers in the array between 40 and 70, both of them included."

Assignment 3:
"Suppose you have a text file (e.g.input.txt) stored some where on your machine, where each line 
holds an integer number. Develop a java program that reads this text file and output some statistics 
about these numbers in another text file (e.g. output.txt).

1.Create two files on your machine, one to read from and another to write your output.
2.Copy the numbers in the table below to your input file.
3.Use both file reading/writing techniques discussed in class.
4.Use Arraylist to store these integer numbers and perform the required calculations.
5.Output the following information: counter of the numbers, the maximum number, theminimum number and the average value."

Assignment 4:
"Using object oriented programming concepts described in class, create student class with the following specifications 
(handled in student class):

1.Any student has a name.
2.Any student has an age, the acceptable age is between 16-20 
(in case of out of rangevalue: print “this age is out of range” then set 16 as value).
3.Any student has a gpa, the acceptable gpa is between 50-100 
(in case of out of rangevalue: print “this gpa is out of range” then set 80 as value).
4.The class has method named “Display_info()”, that prints in a nice format the student’sname, age and gpa."

Assignment 5:
"Using both OOP concepts and string related functions described in class, create CreditCardclass where any 
card holds the following properties:
1.Name (String): the acceptable nameis of length between 8 to 14characters (default value is Card-Name).
2.Number (String):the acceptable number is of form xxx-yyyand startswith 87(default value is87x-yyy).
3.Type (String):the acceptable type is either VISA or MASTER (default value is VISA).
4.Pin (int):theinteger value of the secondthree numbers of the card number(default value is 000).
5.The class has method named “Display_info()”, that prints in a nice format the credit card information"

Assignment 6:
"Assume a textfile - that holds information about students - is stored on your machine, where each line
holds are cord for a single student with the following format(firstname-lastname-address - age - gpa). 
Create student class with the following properties:
1.Any student has a first name, last name, address, age (Integer) and gpa (Integer).
2.Create a default constructor (use default values of your choice) besides the set/get functions.
3.Method named “Display_info()”, prints in a nice format the student’s information."
